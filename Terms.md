  * **Track** (TRK) - the answer to the question "which way am I going." This is the direction you are actually moving relative to the earth.
  * **Bearing** - the answer to the question "which way I need to go in order to go directly to the active waypoint."
  * **Turn** - how far you need to turn to go directly to the active waypoint. Turn is the difference between the _track_ and the _bearing_. The direction indicated is the direction of correction.
  * **Course** (desired track, DTK) - the _track_ necessary to parallel a route leg. It is important to distinguish that _bearing_ is relative to the active waypoint from the present position and _course_ is relative to the line between two waypoints: waypoint being navigated to and waypoint being navigated from.
  * **Cross track error** (XTK) - how far you are off the line defined in the definition of _course_. The direction indicated is the direction of correction (10L km means that you are 10 km to the _right_ of course).
  * **Velocity Made Good** (VMG) - the speed of your approach to active waypoint.
  * **Estimated Time En-route** (ETE) - the estimated time you will spend reaching active waypoint.
